# AutoExpo Backend API

üöó **Welcome to the AutoExpo backend API documentation!**

AutoExpo is a multi-page application (MPA) that serves as both the backend and frontend, providing dynamic HTML pages using Handlebars to showcase a diverse collection of cars and car-related information.

## üìÇ Application Structure

AutoExpo is organized into several key components:

- **Config**: Contains configuration files for database (MongoDB) setup, Express.js, and routing.
- **Controllers**: Houses the controllers responsible for handling different routes and functionalities, including authentication, car management, catalog display, user registration, and more.
- **Middlewares**: Includes middleware functions for tasks like authentication, setting default page titles, guarding routes, and managing user navigation.
- **Models**: Defines data models for cars, extras, and users.
- **Services**: Contains service modules responsible for handling authentication, car-related operations, and more.
- **Static**: Stores static assets such as images and the `styles.css` file.
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions, including error parsing.

## üåê Views

AutoExpo utilizes Handlebars (HBS) templates for rendering dynamic HTML pages. The `views` directory consists of various HBS templates, including layouts, partials, and individual page templates such as the catalog, car details, user registration, and more.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üõ£Ô∏è API Routes

AutoExpo defines various API routes and controllers to handle different functionalities:

  - **/about** - GET route for the about page.

- **Auth Controller**: _Manages user authentication and registration routes. The authentication route is accessible to all guests and does not require any specific permissions._

  - **/auth/login** - GET and POST routes for user login.
  - **/auth/register** - GET and POST routes for user registration.
  - **/auth/logout** - GET route for user logout.

- **Car Controller**: _Handles routes related to car management. The car route is accessible to all users and does not require any specific permissions._

  - **/car/edit/:id** - GET and POST routes for editing car details.
  - **/car/delete/:id** - GET and POST routes for deleting cars.

- **Catalog Controller**: _Manages routes for accessing the car catalog. The catalog route is open to all users and does not require any specific permissions._

  - **/catalog** - GET route for browsing and searching cars.

  - **/create/car** - GET and POST routes for creating new car listings.

- **Extra Controller**: _Handles routes related to car extras. The extra route has two functionalities:_

  _**Create**_: To access the create extras functionality, users need to have an "admin" role. This means they must be administrators to view the page and add new car extras to the database.
